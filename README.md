# About Us
Welcome to the Eurasian Medieval History Club, where we help aspiring scholars of history dive into their passion! That or help provide inspiration for the upteenth Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings wannabe series! Here we archive information on Classical and Medieval civilizations around the Mediterrean Sea and the Middle East. Users can find all sorts of fascinating information on various scholars, generals, monarchs of these Eras and regions.
*If anyone dares to call Eastern Rome 'Byzantium', they shall be IP banned. That is revisionist nonsense.*
